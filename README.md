# Employee-Satisfaction-prediction

The employee satisfaction prediction algorithm was developed as a project for an introduction to Artificial Intelligence class I took in school. This algorithm leverages the employee satisfaction index dataset available on the Kaggle platform, and applies Machine Learning techniques such as Naives Bayes, Multi Perceptron and Logistic Regression for model training, and predict if an employee will be satisfied or not.


# Dataset

The dataset used for this algorithm is included in this repository and was downloaded from the Kaggle platform. The original dataset contains various features specific to each employee such as salary, job role, age, etc., and most importantly the indication from each employee if they were satisfied or not. I elected to only use features I deemed pertinent to the satisfaction of the employee.

# Implementation

The algorithm is implemented in Python and utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks. The main script, employee_satisfaction_script.py, contains the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

# Results
The algorithm provides predictions and analysis of employee satisfaction levels based on the trained models. It generates metrics such as  precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the models. The evaluation results can be found in the output generated during script execution.
